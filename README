Minesweeper solver
==================

This is a program that does one of two things:

1.  Takes a complete minesweeper board, a starting point and proceeds to figure
    out and print a step by step solution. Each "step" is whatever can be
    figured out by looking at a board without actually clicking anything. When
    the program figures out a step it does all the "clicks" and proceeds to
    figure out the next step. It stops when all the mines are flagged or when
    it encounters a situation where no progress can be made without guessing.

2.  Takes a partial solution, figures out every mine and non-mine cell it can
    and prints a board with deduced mines and clear cells.

The boards shall be represented as text. Each line of text stands for one row
in a minesweeper board. Each letter or digit character is interpreted as a
cell. Whitespace is ignored. Characters for cells are as follows.

    ?   Unknown
    .   Clear
    #   Mine
    1-8 Number of surrounding mines

If a given board contains no unknown cells then it is taken that the user is
asking for a complete solution from a given starting point. Starting point
shall be provided via command-line arguments. If the board does contain unknown
cells then the program shall figure out one step and print that.

Note that surrounding cell counts are needed for partial boards.

Partial board mine counts are checked for consistency and an error will be
emitted if counts do not line up with known mines.
